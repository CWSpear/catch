Catch: Broadcatching made easy.
=====

**[Catch](http://www.giorgiocalderolla.com/index.html#catch)** is a Mac OS X application that runs in the menubar as an icon, and will automatically download any new torrent files in your **[ShowRSS](http://showrss.karmorra.info/)** feed to a folder you can choose, and optionally open them in your favorite BitTorrent client. You will never miss an episode again :)

Also, it's *free*. And open-source.
